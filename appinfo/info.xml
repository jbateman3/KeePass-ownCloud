    <description>This is a Password Viewer for KeePass databases kdbx. 

		NOTE 1: This is a viewer only! Passwords cannot be edited, added or removed.
		
		NOTE 2: Only supports KeePass databases with the default encryption and password protection only. 
	
        NOTE 3: This is primarily intended as a password VIEWER, e.g. for a local ownCloud instance on your own WPA2 protected LAN. If you trust yourself enough as security expert, you can use this app behind an SSL secured server for a neat cloud solution. The app will be blocked (with message) if not accessed thru https, which will result in your passwords not being loaded (decrypted) and shown. To prevent this, use ownClouds own 'Force SSL'-function on the admin page, or use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) on your server. Also, make sure your server hasn't any kind of vulnerabilities (POODLE, CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection, Privilege Escalation, Remote Code Execution, to name a few).
